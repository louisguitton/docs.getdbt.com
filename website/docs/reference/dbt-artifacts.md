The following files are generated by dbt in the `target` directory. They are used to generate documentation.

### manifest.json

This file contains a full representation of your dbt project in a single file. Resources like models, tests, and macros are all represented inside of this file. The docs site uses this file to render information about your models, their tests, their relationships, and so on. Members of the community have used this file to run checks on how many models have descriptions and tests.

This file is generated by running `dbt compile` or `dbt run`


### run_results.json

This file contains information about the last run of dbt. Crucially, it contains the compiled SQL for every model in your project. dbt uses this file to render the compiled sql directly into the documentation site.

This file is generated by running `dbt run`


### catalog.json

This file contains information from your data warehouse about the tables and views produced by the models in your project. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site.

This file is generated by running `dbt docs generate`.

### index.html
An empty documentation website â€” the details of this site are populated by the above `.json` files.

This file is generated by running `dbt docs generate` and is based on the code found in the [dbt-docs repo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs).
